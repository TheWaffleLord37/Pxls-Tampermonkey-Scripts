### For any of these scripts to work you need to add the Tampermonkey extension to your browser:<br>https://www.tampermonkey.net
Once you have Tampermonkey installed, clicking on any of the links below will redirect you to a page where you can install that script with one click.<br>
If you don't have Tampermonkey installed when clicking a link, your device will try to save the script as a file instead.<br><br><br><br><br>
