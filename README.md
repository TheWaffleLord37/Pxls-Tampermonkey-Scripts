## Below is a list of every known publicly shared Tampermonkey script made for pxls.space.
It is sorted from what I've personally found to be the most useful to least useful.<br>
If you believe any changes should be made such as swapping their order around, adding a script, or removing a script, feel free to make a pull request, or dm me on Discord asking for me to change it. @thewafflelord<br><br><br>

### For any of these scripts to work you need to add the Tampermonkey extension to your browser:<br>https://www.tampermonkey.net
Once you have Tampermonkey installed, clicking on any of the links below will redirect you to a page where you can install that script with one click.<br>
If you don't have Tampermonkey installed when clicking a link, your device will try to save the script as a file instead which will not affect the site.<br><br><br><br><br>
